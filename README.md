## BookBot is my first project!

### How to use

1. At the root directory of the projet, create a directory named "books": 

        mkdir books
        
2. Download the book below and save it as a .txt file in the newly created directory "books".

        cd books
        curl -o frankenstein.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt
